## Summary

As a team of 5 DAs, we designed and implemented data cleaning processes on the shark attacks dataset. We analysed the findings from the dataset to perform a market prioritisation exercise for an imaginary company "Surfhack inc." which makes shark-proof surfboards. 

Factors considered in the analysis included the activities involved in shark attacks, the geographical range of attacks, the key species responsible for attacks, location of injuries and the impact of colour on provoking shark attacks. 

## Conclusions

The team concluded the following:
* That North Amercia is the key continent for shark attacks.
* That Australia and South Africa were also hotspots for attacks.
* That White Sharks were responsible for more than twice as many attacks as any other shark
* That surfing was the most common activity involved in shark attacks
* That blue was the most frequent colour involved in provoking shark attacks, though the result was not statistically significant

The slides presenting the analysis can be found at: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AcStCWU1I0Chv8IotGY-YpkgeTUgkcambRrrIOruRRU/edit#slide=id.p

## Install

The data cleaning and visualisations used the following packages:
* numpy
* pandas
* pyplot from matplotlib
* colorcet
* seaborn
* re

The code was constructed and run in a mixture of Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab. The full code can be found at this link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J5Ji-JcCCYNftvEPt8cI0WJWHo6yGbbC?authuser=0#scrollTo=Y2QRsjbE2JlQ
